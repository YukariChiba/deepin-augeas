Description: Augeas command line tools
 Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in their
 native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes are made
 by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.
 .
 This package provides command line tools based on libaugeas0:
 - augtool, a tool to manage configuration files.
 - augparse, a testing and debugging tool for augeas lenses.

Description: Development files for writing applications based on libaugeas0
 Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in their
 native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes are made
 by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.
 .
 This package includes the development files to write programs using the Augeas
 API.

Description: Augeas configuration editing library and API
 Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in their
 native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes are made
 by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.
 .
 The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
 details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
 format and the transformation into a tree.

Description: Set of lenses needed by libaugeas0 to parse config files
 Augeas parses configuration files described in lenses into a tree structure,
 which it exposes through its public API. Changes made through the API are
 written back to the initially read files.
 .
 Lenses are the building blocks of the file <-> tree transformation; they
 combine parsing a file and building the tree (the get transformation), with
 turning the tree back into an (updated) file (the put transformation).
 .
 The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
 details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
 format and the transformation into a tree. This package includes the official
 set of lenses.

 This package contains the generated documentation for the lenses shipping in
 the augeas-lenses package.
